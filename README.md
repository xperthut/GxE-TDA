This is a hypothesis extraction tool from high dimensional phenomix dataset. This tool is mainly built in `C++`. The object that we generate from our method is a graph and we use [D3](https://d3js.org/) to visualize our object.

## Library
The library uses `c++14` and requires [Boost](http://www.boost.org/) with version 1.48.0 or more recent. It is a multi-platform library and compiles on Linux, Mac OSX and Visual Studio 2015.

## Website
```R
The interactive php based website uses the output generated by the library. Library generates graph in JSON format and the website reads this JSON file to visually represent the object. Use any php server (Apache) to host the website. 
```

## Library + Website
Follow the steps to interface Library with the website:
```R
1. Create a folder named `Data` under the directory `Website`.
2. Under `Data` directory, create two folders named `csv` and `json`.
3. Allow `csv` folder read only permission and 'json' folder both read and write permission.
4. Place your csv data file to `Website/Data/csv` folder.
5. During running the library, set `-RD` param to `Website/Data/json` and set `-WD` param to `Website/Data/json`
6. The library will read the csv file from `-RD` location and write the json file to `-WD` location.
7. If `-RD` parameter is not specified then the code will search the csv file from the exe file location.
8. If `-WD` parameter is not specified then the code will create output json file to the exe file location.
7. Refresh the website to observe the topological object.
